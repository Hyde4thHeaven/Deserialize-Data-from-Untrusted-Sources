Previously on my episode, we talk about vulnerability in yaml.load(), the one of most famous data-loader functions. Today I will exploiting about **Data deserialization** via pickle which provides for efficient binary deserialization and loading of Python datatypes.

## Solution - DO NOT USE pickle()
**pickle()** 
  
**Another secure function is done!** Secured coding is just a flipped hand when you know the hint!

Let's hunt more vulnerable code to make **Code for Security** next episode. Stay tuned!
